    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This is a recipe for homemade Hash Browns</p>
    <p>It takes 35 minutes to make for 4 servings</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed. </li><br>
        <li> Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes. </li><br>
        <li> Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping. </li><br>
        <li> Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. </li><br>
        <li> Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
